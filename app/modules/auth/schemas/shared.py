"""
Shared schemas for auth module.

Contains Pydantic schemas that are shared between requests.py and responses.py.
Use this for common data structures that appear in both request and response schemas.

"""

# Currently no shared schemas in auth module.
# Add shared Pydantic BaseModel classes here when needed.
# Example patterns (from farmers module):
# - Base schemas with common fields (e.g., FarmerDataBase)
# - Nested objects used in both request/response (e.g., PinPointSchema)
